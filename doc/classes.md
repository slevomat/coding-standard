## Classes

#### SlevomatCodingStandard.Classes.BackedEnumTypeSpacing ðŸ”§

* Checks number of spaces before `:` and before type.

Sniff provides the following settings:

* `spacesCountBeforeColon`: the number of spaces before `:`.
* `spacesCountBeforeType`: the number of spaces before type.

#### SlevomatCodingStandard.Classes.ClassLength

Disallows long classes. This sniff provides the following settings:

* `includeComments`: should comments be included in the count (default value is false).
* `includeWhitespace`: should empty lines be included in the count (default value is false).
* `maxLinesLength`: specifies max allowed function lines length (default value is 250).

#### SlevomatCodingStandard.Classes.ClassConstantVisibility ðŸ”§

In PHP 7.1+ it's possible to declare [visibility of class constants](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/class_const_visibility). In a similar vein to optional declaration of visibility for properties and methods which is actually required in sane coding standards, this sniff also requires declaring visibility for all class constants.

Sniff provides the following settings:

* `fixable`: the sniff is not fixable by default because we think it's better to decide about each constant one by one, however you can enable fixability with this option.

```php
const FOO = 1; // visibility missing!
public const BAR = 2; // correct
```

#### SlevomatCodingStandard.Classes.ClassMemberSpacing ðŸ”§

Checks lines count between different class members, eg. between last property and first method.

Sniff provides the following settings:

* `linesCountBetweenMembers`: lines count between different class members

#### SlevomatCodingStandard.Classes.ClassStructure ðŸ”§

Checks that class/trait/interface members are in the correct order.

Sniff provides the following settings:

* `groups`: order of groups. Use multiple groups in one `<element value="">` to not differentiate among them. You can use specific groups or shortcuts.

**List of supported groups**:
uses,
enum cases,
public constants, protected constants, private constants,
public properties, public static properties, protected properties, protected static properties, private properties, private static properties,
constructor, static constructors, destructor, magic methods,
public methods, protected methods, private methods,
public final methods, public static final methods, protected final methods, protected static final methods,
public abstract methods, public static abstract methods, protected abstract methods, protected static abstract methods,
public static methods, protected static methods, private static methods,
private methods

**List of supported shortcuts**:
constants, properties, static properties, methods, all public methods, all protected methods, all private methods, static methods, final methods, abstract methods

```xml
<rule ref="SlevomatCodingStandard.Classes.ClassStructure">
	<properties>
		<property name="groups" type="array">
			<element value="uses"/>

			<element value="enum cases"/>

			<!-- Public constants are first but you don't care about the order of protected or private constants -->
			<element value="public constants"/>
			<element value="constants"/>

			<!-- You don't care about the order among the properties. The same can be done with "properties" shortcut -->
			<element value="public properties, protected properties, private properties"/>

			<!-- Constructor is first, then all public methods, then protected/private methods and magic methods are last -->
			<element value="constructor"/>
			<element value="all public methods"/>
			<element value="methods"/>
			<element value="magic methods"/>
		</property>
	</properties>
</rule>
```
